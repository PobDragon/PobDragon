This is an Android app to help with the Pendragon battle rules. 

If you don't know what Pendragon is, why are you here?
Here's a link to the wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendragon_%28role-playing_game%29
and a link to Greg Stafford's Pendragon page. http://www.gspendragon.com/

This should aid with the "Book of Battle" - to see what the attacks do and their prerequisites is quite handy.
